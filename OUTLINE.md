# computer vision basics workshop outline

- Introduction _(10 mins)_
  - What is computer vision and it's uses
  - Aim of this workshop - practical learning
  - Prereqisites - basic python knowledge (mention for anyne who didnt attend previous workshop)
- How are images represented in computers? _(11 mins)_
  - pixels, RGB, nested lists, multidimensional arrays
- Libraries we'll be using _(10 mins)_
  - numpy : to represent multidimensional arrays (and thus images)
  - matplotlib : showing images
  - opencv : image manipulation among other things
- Colab setup from github _(10 mins)_
- Theory mixed with hands on exercise: _(60 mins)_
  - Downloading, reading and showing an image _(10 mins)_
  - Overview of the image coordinate system _(10 mins)_
  - Pixel manipulation _(10 mins)_
  - Processing _(10 mins)_
    - Translation
    - Rotation
  - Image arithmetic _(10 mins)_
  - Masking _(10 mins)_
- Moving foward _(20 mins)_
  - Levels of computer vision abstraction
    - Preprocessing for basic deep learning : use libraries, no math needed
    - Computer vision research - difference in math understanding, note on linear algebra and matrices
  - handful of cool computer vision projects - a showcase
  - Exercises and resources for those who want to experiment more
